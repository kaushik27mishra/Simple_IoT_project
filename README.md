# Simple_IoT_project
It's a simple IOT project which I made during summer 2019. Using 2 ESP8266 on cloud computing platform Thingspeak and NODE Red. 

A switch connected to node MCU of device1 when pressed, lights LED of device 2. Simultaneously, a temperature  sensor connected to node MCU if device 2 sends the temperature  data to device 1 where NodeRed  dashboard is used to view a chart representing  the data.
